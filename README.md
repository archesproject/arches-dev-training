To review the training slide deck, clone the repo and from the root directory run:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then start the Fusuma server by running:

```bash
yarn run serve
```

After starting the server, you should see the local port on which the server is running. For example:

```bash
Running on http://localhost:60729 #this port number will be different in your console.
```

to build the page locally, run:
```bash
yarn run build
```

...and deploy to gh-pages, run:
```bash
yarn run deploy
```

Fusuma.js is used to display the developer training slides. For more information on Fusuma, Fusuma slide syntax, and slide examples, visit: [Fusuma](https://github.com/hiroppy/fusuma)
