## Deployment considerations:
-   What are the organizational specific considerations?
    -   Are there institutional hosting requirements? Is in-house hosting required? Is there sufficient in-house resources to manage an in-house solution? Is there existing in-house expertise in hosting?
    -   Is there existing in-house experience with a specific cloud? AWS? Azure?
-   How much usage is expected?
    -   How many people will be searching? editing? creating reports?
-   What Resource Models being used?
    -   Is the data file heavy (Images, PDFs, etc)?
    -   How deeply nested is the Resource Model?
