## Deployment Takeaways

-   Every deployment is different. 
    -   There are a lot of decisions to be made regarding production deployments, ranging from usage, redundancy requirements, to the complexity of resource models.
-   The Arches Development Team typically follows the following patterns:
    -   Cloud Hosting solution unless your organization requires In House hosting
    -   Distributed Architecture provides a more robust ability to expand with usage and re-use resources.
    -   Linux/Docker allows quick deployment and dependancies that have been tested to work.
    -   AWS is the cloud that is most widely used among the Development Team.
