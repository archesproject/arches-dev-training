## Design Goals

- Open Source
- Multi-language
- Standards based
    * CRM - Conceptual Reference Model (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/)
- Graph Data Structure
    * Supports concept management
    * Allows for a dynamic logical data model (graph) with a static physical model (db schema)
    * PostgreSQL(relational + JSON) ideal for its spatial capabilities
- Interoperable: Data could be used in other systems
- These qualities make Arches highly adaptable to different use cases and geographic contexts
