## Packages

- A package contains all the data you'd like loaded into your Arches implementation
    * business data
    * concepts/reference data
    * resource models/branches
    * datatypes/functions/widgets
    * map layers
- Each of these components can be loaded separately
- The whole package can be loaded from local file system or directly from github
- Also contains package specific settings (e.g. load order of business data, date format of business data)
- A local package may be updated if you make changes in your deployment of Arches (eg changes to branches and/or resource models)
