## Importing a model & data

- Now, let's test the new datatype by importing a model and some instance data that implement it:
```bash
#commands to import model & data here...
```
- The data load can be verified by running the following SQL (you should see tiles containing addresses in the results):
```SQL
select * from tiles;
```
